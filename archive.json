There P1 generates an ephemeral KEM key pair pk/sk and sends it together with of the encrypted value using P2's public KEM key to P2. In return P2 sends two encrypted values, one using the ephemeral public key pk and one using the public KEM key of P1. Finally all concatenate the three resulting keys using a hash function.\r\nShould we extend Section 5.1.3.4 accordingly also adding an ephemeral KEM key?",
